Wallet mnemonic

`const mnemonic = ''`

You need to put there node web socket provider (Ankr for example)

`const provider = new ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider('wss://apis.ankr.com/wss/')`

Here you need to put how much you want to buy BNB, there is 0,001 BNB for example

`const amountIn = ethers.utils.parseUnits('0.001', 'ether')`

Important is to adjust gasPrice and gasLimit for amount you want to buy, gasPrice and gasLimit have WEI value

```
{
    gasPrice: '10000',
    gasLimit: '2000000'
},
```
